# COVID19-Portugal
The impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal

In this repository, I share my model code reproducing the results and figures in the article published in X (to be filled in). 
The basic model is taken from the manuscript published on MedRxiv "Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term 
government intervention on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic" by Alexandra Teslya, Thi Mui Pham, Noortje G. Godijk, 
Mirjam E. Kretzschmar, Martin C.J. Bootsma and Ganna Rozhnova

The model parameters were chosen to reflect the Portuguese data available from 

https://covid19.min-saude.pt/ponto-de-situacao-atual-em-portugal/ 

and coded in Mathematica 10.0.2.0 on Mac OS X El Capitan, Version 10.11.5. 

The purpose of the model is to demonstrate that stringent social distancing measures can reduce the number of COVID-19 cases with severe symptoms and can buy time for the healthcare system and other government institutions to prepare for controling the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. The basic reproduction number, the initial number of infected and exposed individuals were obtained by the least squares fit of the model to the data (not shown). Note that in future, when more data become available, the model parameters should be estimated using e.g. Bayesian framework.
